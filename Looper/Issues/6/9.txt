ISSUES 6/9

Timig: Still issues with the timing. Not sure if it makes more sense to have 
multi-threads so we can have a timer going in a different loop or what. 
Checking serial takes up a good amount of time and that is throwing the 
consistency of the loop off.

Resistors: The resistors are beginning to lose some of there resistance, we
need ones that can last a long time or we need to look into a different protocol
for relaying this data.
